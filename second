    <desc lang="de">Die 16jährige Miley Stewart wollte bereits als Kind Sängerin werden. Um trotz Pop-Karriere noch ein normales Leben führen zu können, erfanden Miley und ihr Vater Robbie die Kunstfigur Hannah Montana. Zu den ganz wenigen, die außer ihrer Familie wissen, wer hinter dem Künstlernamen steckt, zählt auch Mileys beste Freundin Lilly. Auf Lillys Geburtstagsparty kommt es zum Eklat, denn ein Paparazzo hat Miley bis zur Party verfolgt und diese getraut sich nicht, ihre Verkleidung abzulegen. Als Hannah steht sie ungewollt im Mittelpunkt der Party - sehr zum Ärger von Geburtstagskind Lilly. Robby will nicht, dass Hannah Montana seiner Tochter das Leben vermasselt und bringt Miley deshalb zurück in ihren Heimatort in Tennessee. Aber auch im kleinen beschaulichen Örtchen Crowley Meadows fällt es Miley schwer, sich von ihrer Erfindung zu trennen</desc>

    <desc lang="de">In der Waschküche eines teuren Apartment-Hauses wird Sarah, die Nanny des Ehepaars Petersen, erschlagen in einem Wäschetrockner entdeckt. Castle kann mit seiner Wortgewalt die versammelten Polizisten überzeugen, dass ein Nachbar der Mörder sein muss. Die Autopsie zeigt, dass das Opfer vor ihrem Tod geschützten Sex hatte, was zur Annahme führt, dass Sarah ihren Mörder kannte. Sarahs Freundin lenkt den Verdacht auf Mister Petersen, der abends oft allein mit der attraktiven Nanny zu Hause war. Diese Spur erweist sich als hinfällig, als Castle anhand der Aufzeichnungen der Liftkamera scharfsinnig erkennt, dass die Fahrt der Nanny in die Waschküche fünf Sekunden weniger lang gedauert hatte als eine Fahrt zurück. Somit verlagert sich die Spur von den Petersens im zwölften Obergeschoss in die 15. Etage - wo die Wohnung des Ehepaares Harris liegt</desc>

    <sub-title lang="de">Der 30. Tag</sub-title>
    <desc lang="de">US-Dramaserie über ein Ärtzeteam des Seattle Grace Hospitals. Der Klinikalltag wird bestimmt von Ehrgeiz, Unsicherheit, medizinischen Herausforderungen und Liebeskummer. Jeder der jungen Ärzte versucht auf andere Weise mit dem Druck zurechtzukommen. In dieser Episode offenbaren sich 30 Tage nach dem Flugzeugabsturz dessen schreckliche Auswirkungen auf das Team: Lexie ist tot, Mark liegt im Koma, und die beruflichen Aussichten von Arizona und Derek, die schwer verletzt wurden, sind höchst ungewiss. Tiefe Spuren hinterlassen die Ereignisse auch bei Meredith, deren beste Freundin Cristina sich in ein Krankenhaus in Minneapolis abgesetzt hat. Die frischgebackene Ausbildungsleiterin der neuen Generation von Erstjahres-Assistenzärzten erweist sich als passende Nachfolgerin von 'Nazi' Bailey, ebenso gefürchtet wie diese</desc>
